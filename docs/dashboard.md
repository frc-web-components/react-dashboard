## Layout

When you first open the app, you will see the following panels:

## Adding, Selecting, and Removing Elements

Elements can be added to the dashboard by dragging them from the `Components` tabl on the sidebar to the dashboard:

To select an element, click on it in the dashboard. Its properties will appear in the `Properties` panel in the sidebar.

To delete a component, either press Delete on your keyboard, right click on the component and select "Remove", or click the red `X` in its `Properties` panel.

## Tab Management

By default, each dashboard starts with a TeleOperated tab and an Autonomous tab. If you need more tabs, you can add them with the `+` button. You can remove tabs by clicking the `x` button on the tab handle. You can rename a tab by double-clicking on the tab handle.

## Setting Element Properties

Element behavior changes based on their properties. A selected element's property values can be set in the Properties view. Property values can be changed through their input fields:
